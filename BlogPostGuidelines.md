If you've created a new library or a new version of a library, we encourage you to do a guest blog post announcing it for the Google Geo Developers blog.

# Guidelines #

Your guest blog post could contain the following:
  * Introduction to yourself, what you do, and what sites you work on (if public)
  * Motivation/inspiration for creating the library or enhancements
  * Embedded code snippets that show basic usage
  * Embedded iframe example
  * Screenshots of examples, with links to the actual HTML files
  * Photo of yourself

Please write your post in a Google document and share it with Pamela Fox. She'll send feedback or do grammar edits as needed, and then send it around for internal review @ Google, and post it when it's done and ready.
